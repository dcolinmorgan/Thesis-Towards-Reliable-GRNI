Boltzmann showed that entropy is what we really count when we delineate units of time. Furthermore, it has recently been proposed \citep{connes1994neumann} that this increase of entropy we envision for the universe is simply a bias toward the order which we have evolved to identify and thus find meaning in. Rovelli proposes that the future may be no less ordered, that there is no change in total entropy. Order simply manifests in new ways, as in binning socks by color, only to have a colorblind man later bin them by length.

The continuum we inhabit calls for modeling nevertheless, not for the sake of time but to learn the behavior and bounds of the continuous change of life. For such steady-state models as presented here, cell cycle synchronization is key, to measure seperate experiments through similar periods in their development, then presumably under similar GRN regulation. This can be accomplished through starvation, ie media deprivation, to force cells to recover from same stimuli together and thus bring their growth phases into sync. From such a beginning, time-series experiments would then enable quantification beyond simple assumptions of steady-state, enabling modeling of relationship permanency, \ie if links are static, or more likely, if they are as transient as the condition life finds itself inhabiting. This is one of the capabilities we have provided in the vastness of the L1000 dataset. Its high-throughput multiplexing has many time points taken within cell lines, which can feed into a model of network evolution, how links come into being, and thus a potential roadmap for which network conditions preclude any given network outcome.

The LINCS consortium also provides in its L1000 portal small molecule and drug induced perturbation experimental measures in keeping with the shRNA measures we use in \textbf{Paper IV}. It would be very interesting to develop a method for modeling drug perturbation on a network template, which could then be cross-correlated with inverse regulatory interactions in disease. Such pairing of disease and drug information in the context of networks could provide not only novel drug gene-targets, but also open the ability of less specific drugs to target general network modules to achieve the same aim of changing the regulation of key disease pathways.

One straightforward method to achieve this using the same models used here would be to code perturbation design onto small molecule, drug induced perturbation by way of the STITCH database \citep{kuhn2009stitch} or DrugBank \citep{wishart2006drugbank}. Creating such network models based purely on replicate, multiple perturbation experiments could uncover novel uses for drugs which have passed FDA phase I and II safety testing, thereby bypassing many years of safety testing not to mention chemical/structural development \citep{oprea2011drug}. These could then be very easily validated, at least in a rudimentary way through IC50 assay on the various standardized cell lines.
%%NN inf
Beyond perturbation-based inference methods, classic perception neural networks may hold key to further enhancing inference accuracy. Assembling a few layers to account for ingoing and outgoing links, strength as weights and up or down regulation would be easy when matched with a bank of sufficient training data. GeneSPIDER (\textbf{Paper I}) could be such a key, allowing for the creation of much synthetic data for training, with hold out allowing for accuracy evaluation before feeding in real biological data. Furthermore, a bootstrap method drawing from experimental replicates would increase the training data amount as well as feed in a level of robustness where a network can describe many datasets due to varying levels of noise, combinations of experiments.

These past years I have been inspired to study many of the ideas present herein without directly identifying them as such. Over the past year I spent compiling these chapters I enjoyed several popular non-fiction and fiction works. These works reinforced what might be obvious, the idea that genes do not and cannot exist in isolation and that any system-altering force goes against the biologically-investigative process. I came to understand the repercussions of such forces in several different scientific domains as I came to understand this principle more fully in my own. The first external inspiration I have referenced formally from Carlo Rovelli's Order of Time\cite{rovelli}, which I followed reading Nick Pyenson's Spying on Whales\cite{pyenson},  and then Richard Powers' The Overstory\cite{powers}. Most notably, this prospectus suggests a position to the much belabored quandry ''nature vs nurture'', which would seemingly posit that, like the idea that time is an artificial construct of the human mind or the age-old question ''what is the meaning of life'', there can be no separation of the two, nature and nurture, and these are simply bad questions. The challenge we strive to collectively overcome is modeling disease \emph{in vitro}, minimizing changes along the way which would drive the system from its initial wild-type state, \ie culturing practices no matter how stringent the protocol, alters the system under study. Following, studying a tree isolated from its forest brethren does not characterize the wild-type individual nor does investigating an orphaned and abandoned whale calve in captivity capture its true nature. The encompassing system is composed of individuals which are themselves reflections of the constraints dictated by the environment. More to the point, there is no suitable nature without a nurture for it to grow and thrive within, the two are inextricably linked, as previously alluded to in the very beginning of \cref{sec:intro}. We have understood that genes can maintain function over evolutionary time in similar species, \ie functional persistence, which allows transfer of function between newly characterized species within this similarity constraint; however, as equally well know, outside these similar species the gene, protein, etc. can and may very well develop entirely new functions. This demonstrates just how important the environment is to the function of any biomolecule, and thus how crucial it is we faithfully model the interactions within that environment. Such investigation, not excluding or excusing that presented here, often fall short of generalizing to the question initially posited, calling upon statistical tests to determine meaningful insight gained from the abstractions they become; nevertheless humanity's best approaches do over time consistently yield understanding, and as the tide of progress is never completely forward, we must endeavor to push on.

The contributions I have made to the field are: 1) the creation of GeneSPIDER an environment for comparing inference methods; 2) NestBoot, a framework for enhancing many inference methods’ accuracy; 3) BalanceFitError, a method for measuring accuracy of inferred networks when gold standards are unavailable. GeneSPIDER has developed into the benchmarking environment for the consequent two projects. The NestBoot method initially found only a marginal ability to increase inference accuracies by comparing the link overlap across bootstraps. Thus I, along with my coauthor team, designed and implemented a more strict thresholding manner by forming a null link distribution from the inference of networks based upon shuffled data. This lends to the ability of the NestBoot framework to infer accurate networks by defining a way to enforce a naive but conservative FDR threshold. Similarly, our most recent contribution aims to overcome the limitation of scoring inference accuracy when no gold standard network is available by developing another null distribution by which to compare. Unlike our NestBoot null, here GRN links are shuffled after the initial inference to form a null expected-link distribution by which to compare any inferred network’s link composition. This allows us to score the ability of an inferred network to explain data relative to an expected error defined by this null distribution. 

In what I see as the culmination of my PhD studies, I have spearheaded a fourth study, which leverages experimental replicates within a high dimensionality public dataset. Utilizing a less pre-processed version of the data and normalizing in such a way that does not pool replicate experiments, we feed these replicates into our NestBoot FDR-enforcing inference framework. This creates cell type specific GRN, contrasting which allows for the search of conserved links and even modules. My greater ambition for this and any GRN project is to expand and infer using more input data types, and perhaps estimating regulatory dynamics using several time point rather than the steady state our model assumes. Identifying modules common among or specific to any cancer subtype GRN structure could expand the search space when identifying targetable biomarkers. A practical, testable application of biomarker identification in this manner would then be the integration of non-specific, small molecule perturbation data to enable the identification of novel drug-disease matches, \ie repositioning. While this is an ongoing investigation and not included here, it is my ultimate ambition to infer GRNs on whole genome level.

% I have been inspired by the robust relationships present in our natural world, in the way forest root systems propagate between individuals to form reactionary defenses against invasive species and how whale pods can communicate long term relationships among individual members...\\

% Future work hopes to involve the akaike and/or bayesian information criterion (AIC/BIC) to further bolster our results away from any bias we may introduce in our current estimations of inference performance, etc.
